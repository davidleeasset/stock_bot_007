# The project stock_bot_007 -- just for fun.

- Itâ€™s a side project I thought could help me to beat the stock market.
- Since the stock market slid really deep, I lost my passion to add new features.
- The working functionalities:
    - `DailyStockProcessor`
        - Fetch stock trading information from Fugle API.
        - Parse the price and save it into MongoDB.
        - There is a watch list, while processing on the specific stock, check the price movement and notify by the Discord API -`DiscordWebhook`.
    - `PublicNewsFetcher`
        - A Web crawler to crawl news for the specific stock news from cnyes.com and mops.twse.com.tw.
    - `DCBotActions`
        - The interactive interface uses the Discord bot to control the stock watch list.
- The process trigger point:
    - clock.py
        - There are multiple cron tasks set on `DailyStockProcessor` because the market is moving fast while the opening and closing, so I put a couple of different intervals for the task.
    - run_bot.py
        - The interface of discord_bot
- This is a small project, so â€”
    - Considering the trade-off, I choose the easiest way to run all the services.
        - trade-offs:
            - If the service is down, itâ€™s fine.
            - I donâ€™t want to spend too much time maintaining the deployment code.
            - I have sentry to notify me if some exception is happening.
- Technical / Production insight:
    - organized folder structure
        - Runners, vendors, and services are in their own place, would be easy to find them.
    - functionalities are layered:
        - For example the ****daily_stock_processer.py****
            - The main logic is still simple but already separate to `run` / `process_list` / `single_stock_check` and all the vendors like `venders.dc_webhook` and `venders.fugle`.
            - I thought itâ€™s good enough for a side-project which just made for fun ðŸ™‚
    - centralized settings:
        - Easy to maintain like the real environment.
